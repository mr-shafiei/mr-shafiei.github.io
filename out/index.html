<h4>Dear Students,</h4>

<p>I'm afraid I have come down with a stomach illness and will be out on Wednesday, January 7.</p>

<p>But, have no fear, you have plenty to do!</p>

<p>Remember, all of you know something, but some of you might know <em>more</em> about specific things.  Ask questions to each other and help each other out.</p>


<h5>Objectives:</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Continue to work on your GRASPS</li>
	<li>By the end of class today, you should have some work and code in Scratch</li>
	<li>By the end of class today, I would also like for you to complete the following journal prompt</li>
	<li>EXTRA CREDIT (for candy): By the end of clas today, I would like for you to upload a screenshot of your work into Basecamp.</li>

</ul>

<hr>

<h5>Journal Prompt:</h5>

<p>Please write a paragraph that reflects on your team's experience so far with this project.  You should write about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What is something that you are finding to be easy?</li>
	<li>What is something that you are finding to be challenging?</li>
	<li>Is there anything you are worried about?</li>
</ul>


<p>Please type this into Basecamp (either under one of the existing journal entries, or create a new one).</p>



<hr>

<p>Continue being awesome and responsible with the room and equipment.  I'm sorry to miss a day with you, but I'm also confident that you can do a lot of this independently!</p>
