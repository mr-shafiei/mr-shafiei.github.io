## Post-Lab Questions ##

*Complete these questions after you've completed the lab*

1.  Which website (or computer) did you trace?
2.  Where was that final computer located (what was the last hop on your route)?
3.  Did your computer make a direct connection to that website (in other words, did it only take one single hop)?
4.  How many hops did it take to connect to the website?
5.  Compare your results to another person.  Were your routes the same or different?
6.  Based on your observations, make a conclusion about how the internet is built.
7.  Were you surprised that you could determine the location of a computer on the internet?  Why or why not?
