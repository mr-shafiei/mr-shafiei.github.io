# Professional Email 2 #

## Instructions ##

For this assignment, I would like for you to send me an short, formal email making a request for something.  You may follow the template below, but you do not need to stick to it exactly.

Key structural words have been <kbd>highlighted.</kbd>

My email address: <span class="label">chec.shafiei@gmail.com</span>



Possible ideas:

* Request a change to a grade
* Ask to be excused from a class
* Ask for an assignment extension
* Ask for after school help
* Invite me to breakfast


## Grading ##

Like the first email, you will send this to me, I will revise it and then you will rewrite it.  Your grade will be either a 0 or a 100% (A/4) depending on your completion of the process.


## The Template ##
<div class="panel">
Dear Mr. Shafiei,
<br>
<kbd>This is</kbd> Jenna Schwartz <kbd>from your CHEM255 class</kbd>. A few other Chemistry students and I were planning on meeting for lunch at noon on Thursday to become better acquainted and discuss our experiences in class.
<br>
We would love it if you could join us! If Thursday at noon doesnâ€™t work for you, is there another time that might?
<br>
<kbd>Thanks for your consideration,</kbd><br>
Jenna Schwartz
