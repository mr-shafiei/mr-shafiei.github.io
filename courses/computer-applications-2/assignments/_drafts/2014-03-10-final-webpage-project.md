## Steps to Completion ##

### Step 0:  Explore the work of others ###

To get a better sense of the purpose of this project and some inspiration, spend some time evaluating other websites.  Since this may be an unfamiliar format for you, I have provided some links below to get you started.



If you are searching the web, try search phrases such as:

**"Actor's Portfolio Website"**

**"Musician's Portfolio Website"**

**"Athlete's Portfolio Website"**

**"Artist's Portfolio Website"**

**"Doctor's Portfolio Website"**

**"Professor's Portfolio Website"**

### Step 1:  Identify the Purpose of your Website ###

For most practical web design, form follows function.  In other words, your site's design reflects what it is used for.

Please answer the following questions (in an email to <span class="label">chec.shafiei@gmail.com</span>):

#### Content ####
0.  What is your site about?
1.  What content will be needed for the site?
2.  List the sections and features that will be included
3. What already exists and what needs to be developed?


#### Communication ####
1.  What should the site communicate?
2.  What are the primary objectives and goals for the site?

### Step 2:  Create a blueprint

A blueprint is a sketch of how your site is going to look, but more importantly, it contains some functional information (such as where pictures or video would go and how pages link together).


### Step 3:  Write Code ###

Mr. Shafiei will provide you with several basic HTML templates to get you started and to help fill in the gaps in your knowledge.  You are certainly welcome to deviate from them!

Clone templates from:  <kbd>https://github.com/thebobak/final-project</kbd>


### Step 4:  Iterate ###

To iterate means to repeat a process.  If you were chopping carrots, you would finish one and then begin the next.

In the software world, designers and engineers iterate through their code and make small changes each time they pass through.


### Step 5:  Present Your Work ###
