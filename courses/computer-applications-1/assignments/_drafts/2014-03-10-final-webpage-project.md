## Due Date ##

## Steps to Completion ##

### Step 0:  Explore the work of others ###

To get a better sense of the purpose of this project and some inspiration, spend some time evaluating other websites.  

### Step 1:  Identify the Purpose of your Website ###

For most practical web design, form follows function.  In other words, your site's design reflects what it is used for.

Please answer the following questions (in an email to <span class="label">chec.shafiei@gmail.com</span>):


#### Content ####
0.  What is your site about?
1.  What content will be needed for the site?
2.  List the sections and features that will be included
3. What already exists and what needs to be developed?

### Step 2:  Create a blueprint

A blueprint is a sketch of how your site is going to look, but more importantly, it contains some functional information (such as where pictures or video would go and how pages link together).


### Step 3:  Write Code ###

Make sure you push all of your code up to GitHub!!



### Step 4:  Iterate ###

To iterate means to repeat a process.

In the software world, designers and engineers iterate through their code and make small changes each time they pass through.


### Step 5:  Present Your Work ###
