# Professional Email 3 #

## Instructions ##

I would like for you to write a short review of this website, mimicking the template below.  

I have <kbd>highlighted</kbd> some key structural words you should likely keep, but don't have to.

Email to <span class="label">chec.shafiei@gmail.com</span>


## The Template ##
<div class="panel">
<h6>My Review of Netflix</h6>
<p><kbd>The good:</kbd> Netflix for iOS <kbd>gives you</kbd> great-looking streaming movies and shows. The controls are smooth and performance is reliable.</p>

<p><kbd>The bad:</kbd> The streaming library is only a fraction of the larger DVD library. <kbd>You still can't</kbd> add to or change your DVD queue via the app.</p>

<p><kbd>The bottom line:</kbd> <kbd>If you don't mind</kbd> the limited streaming library, Netflix offers great picture quality, smooth controls, and reliable performance.</p>
