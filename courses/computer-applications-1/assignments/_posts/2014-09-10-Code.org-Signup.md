We will use code.org's intro course to supplement our class projects and offer you some challenges:



1. Go to <http://learn.code.org>
2. Create an account (or sign in if you already have one)
3. Once your account is created, look for the <kbd>ADD TEACHER</kbd> button on the page
4. Type in one of the following codes:


```

Period 1:    JJJBAN

Period 2:    TWARFE

Period 4:    HKCGJV


```


Begin on "Stage 2" if you are new to this.  You are welcome to skip ahead for more challenging puzzles.
