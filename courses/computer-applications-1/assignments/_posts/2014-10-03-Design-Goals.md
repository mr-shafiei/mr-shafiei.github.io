## Overview ##

At this point in your project, you most likely have a functional game/app.  Congratulations!

Designers and developers often have to work with deadlines and make sacrifices about what features they would like to have and what they can realistically get accomplished in the time they have.

## Process ##

I would like for you to create two goals for your project.  These will be your requirements for earning different grades:

#### Goal 1:  Minimum Goal ####

What features are absolutely necessary for your game/app to be functional?

*This will be your requirement to earn a "B" on the project*


#### Goal 2:  High Target Goal ###

What features would be nice or cool to have?

*This will be your requirement to earn an "A" on the project*


Please note, these goals are subject to my approval and revisions!
