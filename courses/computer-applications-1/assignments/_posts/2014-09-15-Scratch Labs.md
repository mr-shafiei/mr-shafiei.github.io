## Overview ##

In these labs, we will be learning the basics of the Scratch environment by doing 3 labs.



## Goal ##

Use Scratch's tutorials to understand the interface and basic blocks.

Apply that knowledge to the creation of several interactive pieces.

![scratchsave](/media/2014/09/scratch-save.png)

*Scratch does Autosave, but it is usually a good idea to save your work if you see the <kbd>SAVE NOW</kbd> button*


### Step 5 ###

When you are finished, download the files to your computer and them upload them to your Dropbox portfolio.

1. Go to the <kbd>FILE</kbd> menu
2. Choose <kbd>Download to your computer</kbd>
3. Upload the file to Dropbox the same way you would any other document.
