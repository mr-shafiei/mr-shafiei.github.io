# Design Journal #

Purpose:  To reflect upon your progress and process and plan ahead.

## Due Dates: ##

9/26
10/3
10/9
10/17
10/24


# Basecamp #

Basecamp is a tool that allows you and your team to collaborate and track tasks.

You will get a weekly grade on your team's usage of this!


# Testing/Sharing #

One big part of the process is testing your app and evaluating how your users respond.

We will do this several times:

10/3
10/9
10/17



# Documentation #

The final part of this process will be providing documentation to your user about how your app should be used.

While most of this will be written, I encourage you to explore alternate ways that you can signal to your user how they should interact.

Lastly, your app should be complete with a description and credits (including credits for any digital media you used including picture, sounds, videos or code).
