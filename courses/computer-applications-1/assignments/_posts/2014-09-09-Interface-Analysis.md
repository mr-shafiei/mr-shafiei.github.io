Analyze the user interface (UI) of a game, website, app, device or other interactive in order to gain ideas for your own design and understand various techniques designers use when creating interaction.

## Steps to Completion ##

### Step 1:  Analyze a Product ###

Choose a product to analyze.  This can be a game, website, electronic device, app or anything else that a person uses.


### Step 2:  Prepare Your Report ###

Recall what we read and discussed in class.  Answer the following questions.

1. How do you control or use the product?  What input do you give?  How do you give it (e.g., keyboard?  touch?)?
2. If the product's interface were different (i.e., required the mouse instead of a touchscreen) what might change about the way you use it?
3. What kinds of information does the product give to you?  How does it give you that information (for instance, does it use sound or lights)?
4. How does the product let you know that your interaction was successful (i.e., scored a point in a game)?
5. How do you know that you were not successful?
6. Is there anything you would change about the interface?


### Step 3:  Submit ###

You should submit this on DropBox!
