Computer Applications 1 is a 9-week (advisory-length) survey of some of the uses of computing technology.  There is an emphasis on using computing as a tool for creativity.


The purpose of this course is not to make you an expert at using any one tool, but rather to introduce you to the breadth of tools available while developing your resourcefulness, so you can dive deeper when the time comes.
